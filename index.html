      <p class="loud">The European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement enables Iceland, <span class="tip" title="Working tip">Liechtenstein</span> and Norway (EEA EFTA States) to participate in the EU Internal Market. It covers the free movement of goods, services, capital and persons, competition and state aid rules, and certain horizontal and flanking areas.</p>
      <p class="loud">For an EU act to apply to the EEA EFTA States, it must be incorporated into the EEA Agreement through an EEA Joint Committee Decision. The aim is to incorporate acts as closely as possible to the date of entry into force in the EU in order to ensure that the same rules apply throughout the EEA. </p>
